            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>During my time at SEPT, I collaborated on designing and facilitating three inclusive design thinking workshops specifically for engineering students. The workshops were designed to help participants engage in interactive design exercises to become more aware of and engaged with EDIA (Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility) principles.</p>
